# Boarding-House-For-Animals

This program aims to demonstrate essential principles in object-oriented programming by showing animal boarding through the animals' hierarchy.

The class of Animals is an abstract class that forms a pattern for the abstract classes that inherit it: mammalian, reptile and poultry classes. These classes are abstract and constitute a pattern of an animal from the same hierarchy. Each of these classes has three examples of animals from the same hierarchy. For some animals, such as Dogs, "Owner" property was added.

Following Object Oriented Programming principles, there is an overriding of methods to adapt the method from the parent class, such as toString(), clone(), equals() to the subclasses.

The main program will manage the boarding house by adding animals, activating unique functions for each animal. Also, the main method will clone an animal, update her owner's details and show that there will not be aliasing between the two animals.
